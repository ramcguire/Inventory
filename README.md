[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ramcguire/Inventory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ramcguire/Inventory)

This is a basic proof of concept inventory tracking application. 

To build, type "make" on the command line in this project's directory. Application compiles to default "a.out" (may vary based on system that builds).

Basic usage:
- Run the application (eg. "./a.out")
- To sell an item, input "S" or "s".
- To exit the application, input "Q" or "q".

TODO:
- Handle more than one inventory item
- Add inventory items to stock
- Adjust price of inventory item
- Track total sales
